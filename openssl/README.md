# OpenSSL Windows, How to compile

## Building OpenSSL 1.0.2

### Requirements

  * Openssl Sources ([http://openssl.org/source/](http://openssl.org/source/))

  * Native Perl from ActiveState ([http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/](http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/)) installed and perl being in your PATH

  * Common tools used to compile PHP

### Configure

**It is important to always keep the prefix path as c:/usr/local/ssl. It is the documented default config path in PHP, so it has to be the same in every OpenSSL build**

Configure for Win32

    
    cd  C:\phpbuild\libs\openssl-1.0.2d
    perl Configure --openssldir=c:/usr/local/ssl enable-static-engine VC-WIN32

Configure for Win64

    
    cd  C:\phpbuild\libs\openssl-1.0.2d
    perl Configure --openssldir=c:/usr/local/ssl enable-static-engine VC-WIN64A

The configure will prepare the sources to compile OpenSSL for windows 32bit
and install it under c:/usr/local/ssl.

Modify the path using your configurations. Please note the unix directory
separators / instead of the Windows backslash \.

#### Assembly languages options

PHP build default in 5.2 don't use ASM. PHP build default in 5.3 and later
uses ASM.

    
For Win64 builds, use only:

    
    ms\do_win64a

For win32 builds only:

If you don't want to use assembly language:

    
    ms\do_ms

If you like to use the assembly language files:

If you have MASM (aka “ml”), run:

    
    ms\do_masm

Or if you use NASM:

    
    ms\do_nasm

You should not get any error until now. If you see errors messages, please
check the troubleshooting section in “INSTALL.W32” in the OpenSSL sources.

And for win64:

    
    ms\do_win64a

## Compiling

    
    nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak

If you prefer to build a static library, use this command:

    
    nmake -f ms\nt.mak

If you get the following compilation error (with other letters):

    
    .\crypto\cversion.c(105) : warning C4129: 'p' : unrecognized character escape sequence
    .\crypto\cversion.c(105) : warning C4129: 'l' : unrecognized character escape sequence

Go back to the configure phase and be sure to use only slashed and no
backslashes for –openssldir (or –prefix)

## Testing

The possible point of failures in the OpenSSL implementations are numerous.
Thanks to their tests suite, it is possible to minimize the risk by running it
after each update:

    
    nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak test

## Install

    
    nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak install

or

    
    nmake -f ms\nt.mak install

if you built the static library.
