/**
  This function sets the page attributes for the memory region specified by BaseAddress and

  Caller should make sure BaseAddress and Length is at page boundary.

  Caller need guarentee the TPL <= TPL_NOTIFY, if there is split page request.

  @param  PagingContext     The paging context. NULL means get page table from current CPU context.
  @param  BaseAddress       The physical address that is the start address of a memory region.
  @param  Length            The size in bytes of the memory region.
  @param  Attributes        The bit mask of attributes to set for the memory region.
  @param  AllocatePagesFunc If page split is needed, this function is used to allocate more pages.
                            NULL mean page split is unsupported.

  @retval RETURN_SUCCESS           The attributes were set for the memory region.
  @retval RETURN_ACCESS_DENIED     The attributes for the memory resource range specified by

  @retval RETURN_INVALID_PARAMETER Length is zero.

                                   cannot be set together.
  @retval RETURN_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  There are not enough system resources to modify the attributes of
                                   the memory resource range.
  @retval RETURN_UNSUPPORTED       The processor does not support one or more bytes of the memory
                                   resource range specified by BaseAddress and Length.
