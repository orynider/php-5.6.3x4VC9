ZLib Module for AOLserver 4.5
Release 2.0

This is AOLserver module that implements Zlib interface.  Allows
compressing/uncompressing Tcl strings, gzip file support, and
support for the Ns_Gzip AOLserver routine.


Compiling and Installing:

	To compile this driver, you'll need to have zlib library
	compiled and installed.  Zlib is installed by default on
	OS/X and can be easily added for Linux and FreeBSD (e.g.,
	the zlib-devel package).

	The makefile will produce both a dynamic library and an
	AOLserver module.


libnszlib:

	The library includes an implementation of an "ns_zlib"
	command to provide compression capabilities to a Tcl
	interpreter.  It can be used with the "load" command, e.g.,
	"load libnszlib.so".  The library depends on AOLserver
	libnsd and Zlib libzlib libraries so they need to found in
	the dynamic linker path as well.


nszlib.so:

	The AOLserver module, "nszlib.so", includes a call to both
	add the "ns_zlib" command to all interpreters for the virutal
	server and also installs an "Ns_GzipProc" so that the
	"Ns_Gzip" function can be used to compress content, e.g.,
	at the end of an ADP request.  See the Ns_Gzip(3) man page
	for details.


ns_zlib command:

    	ns_zlib compress data
		Returns compressed string

    	ns_zlib uncompress data
		Uncompresses previously compressed string

    	ns_zlib gzip data
		Returns compressed string in gzip format, string
		can be saved in a file with extension .gz and gzip
		will be able to uncompress it

    	ns_zlib gzipfile file
		Compresses the specified file, creating a file with
		the same name but a .gz suffix appened

    	ns_zlib gunzip file
 		Uncompresses gzip file and returns text
