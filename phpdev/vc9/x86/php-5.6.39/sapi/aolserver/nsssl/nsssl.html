The nsssl Socket Driver
-----------------------

EXPORT NOTICE
This source code is subject to the U.S. Export Administration
Regulations and other U.S. law, and may not be exported or re-exported
to certain countries (currently Afghanistan (Taliban-controlled
areas), Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Serbia (except Kosovo),
Sudan and Syria) or to persons or entities prohibited from receiving
U.S. exports (including Denied Parties, Specially Designated
Nationals, and entities on the Bureau of Export Administration Entity
List).


The nsssl driver supports SSL v2 according to the Netscape SSL
documentation, which you can find at http://developer.netscape.com/.
It was developed using the BSAFE libraries from RSA Data Security at
http://www.rsasecurity.com/.

Some seldom-used SSL v2 features that were omitted include client
certificates and the SHA-1 message digest algorithm.  The reasoning
behind this is that users browsing the web very seldom have client
certificates, let alone know what they are intended for.  Likewise, in
virtually all cases, MD5 is the message digest requested by all
browsers and is fully supported.  In any event, we always welcome
contributions to add these features to nsssl.

We are interested in supporting SSL v3 and welcome your contributions
to help us get there.  An alternative to nsssl is nsopenssl at
http://aolserver.com/modules/.  The nsopenssl module supports SSL v3
using the OpenSSL library and the AOLserver communications driver API.


Compiling and Installing
------------------------

If you have BSAFE, simply type "gmake" in the root directory of the
AOLserver source distribution.  If you want 128-bit/1024-bit
(domestic) security, type "gmake DOMESTIC=1".  If you have a BSAFE
version newer than BSAFE 3, add "BSAFE_VERSION=BSAFEx" where "x" is
"4" or "5".  You may also type "gmake SSL=1" in the nssock directory
if you only want to build nsssl.

The BSAFE encryption toolkit is available from RSA Data Security at
http://www.rsasecurity.com/.


RSA Alternatives
----------------

RSA Data Security, at http://www.rsasecurity.com/, holds the patents
and intellectual rights to the most important algorithms used by SSL:
RSA and RC4.  As a direct result of this the use of anything but RSA
products to implement these algorithms is illegal in the United States
of America and other countries with which the USA has intellectual
property treaties.  The patent on the RSA public-key algorithm expires
in the Fall of 2000, but RSA still retains rights to RC4 and possibly
RC5, RC2, and MD5.  In particular, the source code implementation of
the RC4 cipher used by OpenSSL/SSLeay is, unfortunately, contraband.

While it is theoretically possible to implement SSL v2 using
unencumbered algorithms the performance and security are both too low.
Therefore, we use RSA BSAFE libraries to implement SSL v2.  This is
not intended to be interpreted as an endorsement of any product or
service.  There is an alternative module, nsopenssl, that uses the
OpenSSL library to implement SSL.  This module is available at
http://aolserver.com/modules/ but is not supported in any way by the
AOLserver Team at AOL.


Key Pair and Certificate Request Generation
-------------------------------------------

SSL key pair and certificate request generation is handled by a Tcl
script that you source into a stand-alone AOLserver process.  To use,
change to your AOLserver's root directory and edit the certificate
information at the top of the "./modules/nsssl/keygen.tcl" file.

Once you are satisfied with your information, create your key pair and
certificate request by typing:

./bin/nsd -ft ./modules/nsssl/keygen.tcl

Your directory will now include two files, "keyfile.pem" and
"certreq.pem."  Put the "keyfile.pem" file in a safe place for now.
Send the "certreq.pem" file to your favorite Certificate Authority.
Some Certificate Authorities are http://www.thawte.com/ and
http://www.verisign.com/.  This is not intended to be interpreted as
an endorsement of any product or service.


What To Do Next
---------------

After a while, you will receive a signed certificate from your
Certificate Authority in PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail) format.  Save the
body of the message (and just the body) in a file called
"certfile.pem" and place it and the "keyfile.pem" file into the
"./servers/server1/modules/nsssl/" directory.  If you are using the
domestic version of nsssl, edit the "sslmodule" variable in your
nsd.tcl file to read "nsssle.so".  Check the included nsd.tcl
distributed with this version of AOLserver to see the most-current
options.

That's it!  You're all set and ready to use the SSL v2 protocol to
provide secure access to your web site!


Security Notes
--------------

The "keyfile.pem" is a very sensitive document!  Do not let it out of
your hands, do not send it out over the network, and don't delete it.
It contains your server's private key and if it's lost then you must
cancel your certificate, regenerate the key pair, and get it signed
all over again.  You should put this in the
"./servers/server1/modules/nsssl/" directory.

The "certreq.pem" file generated by keygen.tcl should be deleted once
you receive your signed certificate, though it's harmless to keep
around.  When you need to renew your certificate most Certificate
Authorities should not need it again.

The "certfile.pem" file that you will receive from the certificate
authority is very valuable, though it can be handled in a less-secure
fashion since it's presented to the browsers that visit your web site.
You put this in the "./servers/server1/modules/nsssl/" directory.

Implementation Notes
--------------------

 nsssl vs. nssock
 ----------------- 

 The nsssl and nssock modules are nearly identical, save for the extra
 encryption steps used in SSL.  This release of AOLserver has merged
 nsssl and nssock together.  The SSL=1 variable determines whether
 nssock or nsssl is built.  The advantage is that both nssock and
 nsssl function identically as far as the network is concerned.  This
 also means that nssock and nsssl will continue to share important new
 features such as connection keepalive in both HTTP and HTTPS
 protocols.


 Running AOLserver in Stand-Alone Mode
 -------------------------------------

 What's this about running AOLserver just to source a Tcl script?
 This was an interesting exercise in using Tcl's extensible C API to
 load dynamic objects.  The old nsssl module for AOLserver 2.x used
 the old web-based admin interface with lots of Tcl code bound to
 URL's with ns_register_proc.  Partly because of this design, nsssl's
 key, certificate, and x.509 handling is a mixture of C and Tcl code.
 Since the code as a whole is functional, duplicating the same nsssl
 code into an external executable seemed silly.

  There are three entry points in nsssl:

    Ns_ModuleInit  -- for AOLserver's dynamic loader
    Nsssle_Init    -- for Tcl's dynamic loader (export version)
    Nsssl_Init     -- for Tcl's dynamic loader (domestic version)

   o When AOLserver starts up as a normal web server, it invokes
   Ns_ModuleInit which starts up the socket driver and initializes
   SSL.

   o When AOLserver starts up with ./modules/nsssl/keygen.tcl, the Tcl
   "load" command this file asks the Tcl interpreter to load nsssl.so
   (or nsssle.so) and invoke Nsssl_Init (or Nsssle_Init) which
   registers special key/cert generation Tcl commands and initializes
   SSL, but doesn't start up the socket library.  When the keygen.tcl
   script is finished, it terminates the server and returns.

 In this fashion way we can use the same code for serving pages as
 well as generating the key pair and certificate request without
 having another cumbersome binary executable hanging around.  Now that
 nsssl and nssock are one, maintenance of this code can now be done in
 one place.
