.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBns_rand \fR?\fImax\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
ns_rand generates a cryptographically-secure random number.  If 
.I max
is not specified, the random number is a floating-point value
.I n
such that
.I 0.0 <= n < 1.0.
.PP
If
.I max
is specified, it must be a positive integer between 0 and 2147483647.
The return value is an integer value such that
.I 0 <= n <= (max - 1).
.PP
Internally ns_rand is implemented with the drand48(3) and lrand48(3)
standard library functions.  An internal random seed is generated
the first time ns_rand is called after the server starts.
