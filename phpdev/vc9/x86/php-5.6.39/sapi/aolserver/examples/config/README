README --

This directory contains examples showing how AOLserver, and
many of the standard modules can be configured. 

The base.tcl file contains all of the parameters necessary
to start up an AOLserver. The other example configuration
files found in this directory can be used in conjunction with
the base configuration, by simply concatinating the files
together.

Example:

    % cat base.tcl nscp.tcl > nsd.tcl

The resulting nsd.tcl configuration file will contain
everything necessary to start up the AOLserver, along with
configuration for the control port.
