mynsd
-----

Example of building a custom static linked nsd binary.  This could be
useful to avoid distributing dynamic libraries and/or advanced debugging.

To use:

1.  Build Tcl normally with shared libraries.

2.  Build and instal AOLserver normally.  The install directory should
include static and dynamic libaries in the lib/ subdirectory.

3.  Build Tcl again with --disable-shared.

4.  Modify the config structure in mynsd.c and Makefile for the modules
you would like to use.

5.  Comment out any AOLserver modules from the ns/server/{server}/modules
section of your config file (the cooresponding config sections will
continue to be used).

6.  Type "make AOLSERVER=/you/install/dir install"

7.  Use mynsd as you would nsd.
