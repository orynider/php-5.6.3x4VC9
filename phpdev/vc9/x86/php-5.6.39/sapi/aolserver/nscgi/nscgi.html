<h3><a name="Theory_of_Operation">Theory of Operation</a></h3>

<p>The nscgi module provides the traditional Common Gateway Interface
(CGI) that web servers use to run external applications.  The nscgi
module works well for small- to medium-sized applications.  For large
applications, it should not be used due to the severe load that running
external applications will place on a system.  More modern approaches
use ADP, Tcl, and C libraries instead.</p>

<h3><a name="Known_Issues">Known Issues</a></h3>

<p>The Common Gateway Interface is inefficient, wasteful, and slow --
and nscgi is no exception.  AOLserver provides a better solution in the
form of a robust, in-process scripting language with rich Tcl and C
API's.  The nscgi module should only be used for legacy applications for
which no redesign is possible.</p>

<h3><a name="Configuration_Options">Configuration Options</a></h3>

<p>The following options are available for configuring the nscgi module:</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Option</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Default</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>environment</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
    <td>The name of the config section which contains the additional
      environment variable names and values to set before executing the
      CGI.  The config section is a subsection of the "ns/environment"
      config section.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>gethostbyaddr</td>
    <td>boolean</td>
    <td>false</td>
    <td>Whether to resolve the peer IP address to its hostname when
      setting the REMOTE_HOST environment variable.  If "false", the
      peer IP address will be used instead.  Caution: turning this
      option on can negatively impact performance due to the overhead of
      having to perform a DNS look-up on every CGI request.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>interps</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
    <td>The name of the config section which contains the mappings from
      file extensions to CGI interpreters to execute the CGI with.  The
      config section is a subsection of the "ns/interps" config
      section.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>limit</td>
    <td>integer</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Maximum number of concurrent CGI requests to execute.  "0" means
      unlimited.</td>

    <td>string</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
    <td>
      <p>Maps relative URIs or glob patterns to filesystem paths or
      executables.  The <b>map</b> option's value is of the form:</p>

      <blockquote><i>method pattern path</i></blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li><i>method</i> refers to the HTTP request method (i.e., HEAD,
        GET, POST, etc.)</li>
        <li><i>pattern</i> refers to either a relative URI or a glob
        pattern to match on the HTTP request.  This is how nscgi
        determines whether a request is a CGI request and which
        <b>map</b> rule applies.</li>
        <li><i>path</i> is optional, when specified, indicates either
        the directory where the CGI executables can be found, or the
        executable that should be used to fulfill the CGI request.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If <i>path</i> is not specified, then the URL must refer a file
      which is the CGI executable.  If it is specified and is a
      directory, then the filename portion of the URL must refer to a
      CGI executable in that directory.  Otherwise, <i>path</i> must
      refer to a CGI executable which will handle all requests for this
      <i>pattern</i>.</p>

      unlimited.  Mostly useful to limit the size of POST'ed data.</td>

    <td>30</td>
    <td>Amount of time to wait in the queue when the  concurrency limit
      has been reached.  Server will respond with a 503 Service
      Unavailable error on timeout.  If <b>limit</b> is set to "0", this

    <td>boolean</td>
    <td>false</td>
    <td>Controls whether the CGI will inherit the server process's
      environment variables or not.  Enabling this could potentially
      leak sensitive information from the parent's environment if the

      some common error-handling code.</td>
