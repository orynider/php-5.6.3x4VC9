2.0.5 2017-11-04
========

* Same as 2.0.5RC1 (no bugs were reported in that release candidate)

2.0.5RC1 2017-10-15
========
* Improve performance when unserializing objects/arrays and serializing objects/arrays/strings in php 5/7.
* Update unserialization of integer object keys for php 7.2: Make those keys accessible when unserializing.
* Properly pick up presence of gcc for default compiler flags (`cc --version` doesn't contain gcc).
  Add -O2 to default gcc compiler flags.
* Use empty string for serializing empty $_SESSION array, similar to "session.serialize_handler=php".
  Older igbinary releases already unserialize the empty string to the empty array.

2.0.4 2017-04-14
========
* Fixes bug #129: Should not call __wakeup() on data which was created by Serializable::unserialize()

2.0.3 2017-03-31
========
* Fixes bug #126: Fatal error: "igbinary_serialize_zval: zval has unknown type 0" (IS_UNDEF)
  Make this a warning instead of a fatal error (and serialize as null instead), since IS_UNDEF is a known type.
  Later releases will fix the root cause of the warning, and consistently omit array/object/other entries for IS_UNDEF.

2.0.2 2017-02-27
========
* Compatible with PHP 5.2 - 7.1
* Fixes crash in Memcached->setMulti (in php 7.0+) when the first level of array elements have references as values.
  Other extensions using igbinary shouldn't be affected.

2.0.1 2016-11-19
========
* Compatible with PHP 5.2 - 7.0
* Fixes bug in session decoder not calling __wakeup() in php 7.0+
* (Enhancement) Reuses identical strings when unserializing objects and arrays in php 7.0+

2.0.0 2016-10-30
========
* Compatible with PHP 5.2 - 7.0 (Adds PHP 7 support)
* Serialization format is unchanged
* Performance improvements for serialization and unserialization in PHP 5.2 - 7.0
* (PHP 7) Don't call __destruct if __wakeup threw an exception (or __wakeup wasn't called yet)
* Ports integration with other extensions to PHP 7.0 (session serialization, Memcached, Redis, APCu, etc.)
* Fixes Windows PECL builds for PHP 5.6+
* Reword warnings for invalid header bytes of serialized data (in igbinary_unserialize).
