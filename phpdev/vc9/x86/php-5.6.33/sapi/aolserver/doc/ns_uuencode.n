.SH NAME
ns_uudecode, ns_uuencode \- commands
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBns_uudecode \fIstring\fR
.sp
\fBns_uuencode \fIstring\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBns_uudecode\fR performs HTTP-style uudecoding and returns the decoded
value.

.PP
\fBns_uuencode\fR performs HTTP-style uuencoding and returns the encoding 
value.  The input \fIstring\fR is limited to a maximum length of 48
characters.  The encoding string will be approximately 33% longer
than the original.

.PP
\fBNote:\fR This is HTTP-style uuencoding/uudecoding which is sometimes
called "htuu" (see RFC 1113).  It is not compatible with the 
format used by the Unix uuencode/uudecode commands, nor is it
base-64 encoding.  

.PP
For base-64 encoding, consider using the base64 Tcl package in tcllib 
(see http://tcllib.sourceforge.net).
