.SH NAME
ns_mktemp, ns_tmpnam \- commands
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBns_mktemp \fItemplate\fR
.sp
\fBns_tmpnam 
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

\fBns_mktemp\fR returns a unique filename based on the \fItemplate\fR you
specify.  \fBns_tmpnam\fR returns a filename that can safely be used 
for a temporary file.

.PP
The \fItemplate\fR for \fBns_mktemp\fR should contain a string with six
trailing Xs, which will be replaced with an alpha-numeric
string of six characters chosen to make the filename unique.  If
\fItemplate\fR does not end with six trailing Xs the empty string
will be returned.

.PP
\fBns_tmpnam\fR calls the tmpnam() C library function, and the results will
depend on your operating system.  On Irix, for example, tmpnam() always
generate a file name using the path-prefix defined as P_tmpdir in the
header file which is "/var/tmp/".

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP

 nscp> ns_tmpnam ;# On Linux
 /tmp/filevuLwaE

 nscp> ns_mktemp /tmp/foobar.XXXXXX
 /tmp/foobar.p6SlaC
