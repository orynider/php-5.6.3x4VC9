.SH NAME
ns_hrefs, ns_quotehtml, ns_striphtml \- commands
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBns_hrefs \fIhtml\fR
.sp
\fBns_quotehtml \fIhtml\fR
.sp
\fBns_striphtml \fIhtml\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBns_hrefs\fR returns a list of all the URLs that the \fIhtml\fR has
<A> links to.  There is currently no provision for normalizing any
relative URL with a specified <BASE> URL.  Also, for a URL to be
returned the HREF attribute must come before any other attributes
(such as TITLE, STYLE, etc.) within the opening <A> tag.

.PP
\fBns_quotehtml\fR substitutes all instances of "<", ">", and "&"
within \fIhtml\fR with their respective HTML entities ("&lt;",
"&gt;", and "&amp;" respectively).  This command is useful
if you want to include \fIhtml\fR in another page as plain text.

.PP
\fBns_striphtml\fR returns a new string that is \fIhtml\fR with
all the HTML tags removed.  HTML entities are left untouched.
