<h3><a name="Theory_of_Operation"></a>Theory of Operation</h3>
An AOLserver "filter" is registered for every connection.&nbsp; This filter looks
 at Tcl hash tables to determine the access controls for the URL and presents
 an HTTP authentication challenge if appropriate.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Known_Issues"></a>Known Issues</h3>
There is some confusion as to whether the locks are being implemented in
 the correct way for this module.<br>
<br>
You can change permissions while a server is running, but there is currently
 no easy way to permanently save those permissions to the configuration file.&nbsp;
 The configuration file is read-only at the moment.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Sample_Configuration"></a>Sample Configuration</h3>
There are no global configuration parameters for nsperm at this time.&nbsp; A
 sample set of permission records is in servers/server1/modules/nsperm.<br>
