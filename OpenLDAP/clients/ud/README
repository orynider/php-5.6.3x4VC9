Users
-----
For users, see the man page on ud.

Installers
----------
For installers, see the header file.  Anything that is configurable is
listed in there as a #define, and the file is pretty well commented.

Kerberos users
--------------
If you're going to use Kerberos, be sure that you have a Kerberos config file
in /etc/krb.conf of the form:

	<realm>
	<realm> <server-for-realm> [ admin server ]

This should be the realm in which users are going to authenticate, which
is not necessarily your realm.

You can certainly have other entries in this file, but you'll need at least
these two.

Also be sure that you have the necessary entries in /etc/services so that
your client knows on which port to find a Kerberos authentication server.
An pair of entries like this:

  kerberos        750/udp         kdc             # Kerberos authentication
  kerberos        750/tcp         kdc             # Kerberos authentication

is fairly typical.
