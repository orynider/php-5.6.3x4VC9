.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP

suitable for use with
.BR ldapmodify (1)
or

.I rootpw
coniguration directive.

.TP
.B \-v

for the secret to hash.
.TP
If -h is specified, one of the following RFC2307 schemes may
be specified:
.IR {CRYPT} ,
.IR {MD5} ,
.IR {SMD5} ,
.IR {SSHA} ", and"
.IR {SHA} .
The default is 
.IR {SSHA} .
.LP
.SH LIMITATIONS
The practice storing hashed passwords in userPassword violates
Standard Track (RFC2256) schema specifications and may hinder
interoperability.  A new attribute type to hold hashed
passwords is needed.
.SH "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS"
Use of hashed passwords does not protect passwords during
protocol transfer.  TLS or other eavesdropping protections
should be inplace before using LDAP simple bind.  The
hashed password values should be protected as if they
were clear text passwords.
