.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B Slapd
is the stand-alone LDAP daemon. It listens for LDAP connections on
any number of ports (default 389), responding
to the LDAP operations it receives over these connections.
.B slapd
is typically invoked at boot time, usually out of
.BR  /etc/rc.local .
Upon startup,
.B slapd
normally forks and disassociates itself from the invoking tty.
If configured in
.BR ETCDIR/slapd.conf ,
the
.B slapd
process will print its process ID ( see
.BR getpid (2)
) to a 
.B .pid
file, as well as the command line options during invocation to an
.B .args
file ( see 
.BR slapd.conf (5)
).
If the
.B \-d
flag is given, even with a zero argument,
.B slapd
will not fork and disassociate from the invoking tty.
.LP
.B Slapd
can be configured to provide replicated service for a database with
the help of
.BR slurpd ,
the standalone LDAP update replication daemon.
See
.BR slurpd (8)
for details.
.LP
See the "OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide" for more details on
.BR slapd .
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-d " debug\-level"
Turn on debugging as defined by
.I debug\-level.
If this option is specified, even with a zero argument,
.B slapd
will not fork or disassociate from the invoking terminal.  Some general
operation and status messages are printed for any value of \fIdebug\-level\fP.
\fIdebug\-level\fP is taken as a bit string, with each bit corresponding to a
different kind of debugging information.  See <ldap.h> for details.
.TP
.BI \-s " syslog\-level"
This option tells
.B slapd
at what level debugging statements should be logged to the
.BR syslog (8)
facility.
.TP
.BI \-n " service\-name"
Specifies the service name for logging and other purposes.  Defaults
to basename of argv[0], i.e.: "slapd".
.TP
.BI \-l " syslog\-local\-user"
Selects the local user of the
.BR syslog (8)
facility. Values can be 
.BR LOCAL0 , 
.BR LOCAL1 , 
and so on, up to 
.BR LOCAL7 . 
The default is
.BR LOCAL4 .
However, this option is only permitted on systems that support
local users with the 
.BR syslog (8)
facility.
.TP
.BI \-f " slapd\-config\-file"
Specifies the slapd configuration file. The default is
.BR ETCDIR/slapd.conf .
.TP
.BI \-h " URLlist"
.B slapd
will serve
.B ldap:///
(LDAP over TCP on all interfaces on default LDAP port).  That is, 
it will bind to using INADDR_ANY and port 389.
The
.B \-h
option may be used to specify LDAP (and LDAPS) URLs to serve.
For example, if slapd is given
.B \-h " ldap://127.0.0.1:9009/ ldaps:/// ldapi:///", 
It will bind 127.0.0.1:9009 for LDAP, 0.0.0.0:636 for LDAP over TLS,
and LDAP over IPC (Unix domain sockets).  Host 0.0.0.0 represents
INADDR_ANY.
A space separated list of URLs is expected.  The URLs should be of
LDAP (ldap://) or LDAP over TLS (ldaps://) or LDAP over IPC (ldapi://)
scheme without a DN or other optional parameters.  Support for the
latter two schemes depends on selected configuration options.  Hosts
may be specified by name or IPv4 and IPv6 address formats.
Ports, if specfied, must be numeric.  The default ldap:// port is 389
and the default ldaps:// port is 636.
.TP
.BI \-r " directory"
Specifies a chroot "jail" directory.  slapd will
.BR chdir (2)
then
.BR chroot (2)
to this directory after opening listeners but before any reading
any configuration file or initializing any backend.
.TP
.BI \-u " user"
.B slapd
will run slapd with the specified user name or id, and that user's
supplementary group access list as set with initgroups(3).  The group ID
is also changed to this user's gid, unless the -g option is used to
override.
.TP
.BI \-g " group"
.B slapd
will run with the specified group name or id.
.LP
Note that on some systems, running as a non-privileged user will prevent
passwd back-ends from accessing the encrypted passwords.  Note also that
any shell back-ends will run as the specified non-privileged user.
.SH EXAMPLES
To start 
.I slapd
and have it fork and detach from the terminal and start serving
the LDAP databases defined in the default config file, just type:
.LP
.nf
.ft tt
	LIBEXECDIR/slapd
.ft
.fi
.LP
To start 
.B slapd
with an alternate configuration file, and turn
on voluminous debugging which will be printed on standard error, type:
.LP
.nf
.ft tt
	LIBEXECDIR/slapd -f ETCDIR/slapd.conf -d 255
.ft
.fi
