.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Data that is held in a QUIPU DSA (available as part of the ISODE package)
is stored in or can be easily converted to the EDB file format.  The
.I edb2ldif
tool is used to convert directory data from EDB file format to the
LDAP Directory Interchange Format (LDIF) used by
.BR slapd (8)
and associated utilities.  The
.BR ldif2ldbm (8)
program can be used to convert the resulting LDIF data into a database
that is compatible with
.BR slapd (8).
.LP
.I edb2ldif
writes LDIF formatted data to standard output.  If you specify a particular
.I edbfile
(or files) to read data from, they are converted.  If no
.I edbfile
is specified, the files named
.BR EDB.root
(if it exists) and
.BR EDB
in the current directory are converted. An entire EDB hierarchy
can be converted using the
.B \-r
option.
.LP
When
.I edb2ldif
is invoked, it will also look for files named
.BR .add
in the directories
where EDB files are found and append the contents of the
.BR .add
file to each entry in the corresponding EDB file. 
Typically, this feature is used to include inherited
attribute values (e.g., objectClass) that do not appear in the EDB files.
.LP
See "The SLAPD and SLURPD Administrator's Guide" for more details on
using
.I edb2ldif,
including step-by-step conversion instructions.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d
Turn on some extra debugging which is written to standard error.
.TP
.B \-v
Enable verbose mode that writes status information to standard error, such
as which EDB file is being processed, how many entries have been
converted so far, etc.
.TP
.B \-r
Recurse through child directories, processing all EDB files found.
.TP
.B \-o
Cause local
.B .add
file definitions to override the global addfile (see the

.TP
.BI \-b " basedn"

.TP
.BI \-f " fileattrdir"
