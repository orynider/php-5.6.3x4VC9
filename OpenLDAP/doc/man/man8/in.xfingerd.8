.SH NAME
in.xfingerd \- Finger to LDAP/X.500 gateway daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B LIBEXECDIR/in.xfingerd [\-f filterfile] [\-i]
.B [\-l] [\-t templatefile] [\-c rdncount] [\-x hostname]
.B [\-b searchbase] [\-p port]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B in.xfingerd
is the LDAP/X.500 finger daemon.  It runs from
.BR inetd (8)
and translates
finger queries into LDAP queries or X.500 queries via LDAP.
It also understands
UFN-style names, so fingering something like "tim howes,umich,us@hostname"
will do a UFN search.
.LP
To arrange to have in.xfingerd started from inetd
add a line like this to your
.BR /etc/inetd.conf (5)
file, or the equivalent:
.LP
.nf
.ft tt
    finger stream tcp nowait nobody LIBEXECDIR/in.xfingerd in.xfingerd
.ft
.fi
.LP
For these changes to take effect with inetd, you will probably have
to send it it a HUP signal.  See
.BR inetd (8)
for more details.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-f " filterfile"
Specify an alternate filter configuration file for use with the
.BR ldap_getfilter (3)

.BR in.xfingerd .
.TP
.B \-i
Run in interactive mode.  With this flag in.xfingerd can be
run from a terminal in "one shot" mode, reading the finger
request from standard input.  This is useful for debugging.

.BR syslog (8).
Note that this flag turns OFF logging.  The default is on.
.TP
.BI \-t " templatefile"

.BR ldap_init_templates (3)

.SH NOTES
The default values for most of the things you can specify with
options are configured at compile time in the
.B include/ldapconfig.h.edit
include file.  Also included there are various messages displayed
by the finger daemon when finding no matches, encountering errors, etc.
You should configure
.B ldapconfig.h.edit
for your site.
