.SH NAME
slapd.conf \- configuration file for slapd, the stand-alone LDAP daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
ETCDIR/slapd.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file
.B ETCDIR/slapd.conf
contains configuration information for the
.BR slapd (8)
daemon.  This configuration file is also used by the
.BR slurpd (8)
replication daemon and by the SLAPD tools
.BR slapadd (8),
.BR slapcat (8),
and
.BR slapindex (8).
.LP
The
.B slapd.conf
file consists of a series of global configuration options that apply to
.B slapd
as a whole (including all backends), followed by zero or more database
backend definitions that contain information specific to a backend
instance.
.LP
The general format of
.B slapd.conf
is as follows:
.LP
.nf
    # comment - these options apply to every database
    <global configuration options>
    # first database definition & configuration options
    database	<backend 1 type>
    <configuration options specific to backend 1>
    # subsequent database definitions & configuration options
    ...
.fi
.LP
As many backend-specific sections as desired may be included.  Global
options can be overridden in a backend (for options that appear more
than once, the last appearance in the
.B slapd.conf
file is used).  Blank lines and comment lines beginning with a `#'
character are ignored. If a line begins with white space, it is
considered a continuation of the previous line.
.LP
Arguments on configuration lines are separated by white space. If an
argument contains white space, the argument should be enclosed in
double quotes.  If an argument contains a double quote (`"') or a
backslash character (`\\'), the character should be preceded by a
backslash character.
.LP
The specific configuration options available are discussed below in the
Global Configuration Options, General Backend Options, LDBM
Backend-Specific Options, Shell Backend-Specific Options, and Password
Backend-Specific Options sections.  Refer to the "OpenLDAP
Administrator's Guide" for more details on the slapd configuration
file.
.SH GLOBAL CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
Options described in this section apply to all backends, unless specifically 
overridden in a backend definition. Arguments that should be replaced by 
actual text are shown in brackets <>.

 [SUP <oids>] [{ ABSTRACT | STRUCTURAL | AUXILIARY }] [MUST <oids>]\
 [MAY <oids>] )
.RS
Specify an objectclass using the LDAPv3 syntax defined in RFC 2252.
The slapd parser extends the RFC 2252 definition by allowing string
forms as well as numeric OIDs to be used for the object class OID.
(See the
.B
objectidentifier
description.)  Object classes are "STRUCTURAL" by default.
.RE
.TP
.B objectidentifier <name> { <oid> | <name>[:<suffix>] }
Define a string name that equates to the given OID. The string can be used
in place of the numeric OID in objectclass and attribute definitions. The
name can also be used with a suffix of the form ":xx" in which case the
value "oid.xx" will be used.
.TP
.B password-hash <hash>
The <hash> to use for userPassword generation.  One of
.BR {SSHA} ,
.BR {SHA} ,
.BR {SMD5} ,
.BR {MD5} ,
and

The default is
.BR {SSHA} .
.TP
.B pidfile <filename>
The ( absolute ) name of a file that will hold the 
.B slapd
server's process ID ( see
.BR getpid (2)
) if started without the debugging command line option.
.TP
.B referral <url>
Specify the referral to pass back when
.BR slapd (8)
cannot find a local database to handle a request.
If specified multiple times, each url is provided.
.TP
.B require <conditions>
Specify a set of conditions (separated by white space) to
require (default none).
The directive may be specified globally and/or per-database.
.B bind
requires bind operation prior to directory operations.
.B LDAPv3
requires session to be using LDAP version 3.
.B authc
requires authentication prior to directory operations.
.B SASL
requires SASL authentication prior to directory operations.
.B strong
requires strong authentication prior to directory operations.
Currently
.B SASL
and
.B strong
conditions are currently same.
.B none
may be used to require no conditions (useful for clearly globally
set conditions within a particular database).
.TP
.B sasl-host <fqdn>
Used to specify the fully qualified domain name used for SASL processing.
.TP
.B sasl-realm <realm>
Specify SASL realm.  Default is empty.
.TP
.B sasl-secprops <properties>
Used to specify Cyrus SASL security properties.
The
.B none
flag (without any other properities) causes the flag properites
default, "noanonymous,noplain", to be cleared.
The
.B noplain
flag disables mechanisms susceptible to simple passive attacks.
The
.B noactive
flag disables mechanisms susceptible to active attacks.
The
.B nodict
flag disables mechanisms susceptible to passive dictionary attacks.
The
.B noanonyous
flag disables mechanisms which support anonymous login.
The
.B forwardsec
flag require forward secrecy between sessions.
The
.B passcred
require mechanisms which pass client credentials (and allow
mechanisms which can pass credentials to do so).
The
.B minssf=<factor> 
property specifies the minimum acceptable
.I security strength factor
as an integer approximate to effective key length used for
encryption.  0 (zero) implies no protection, 1 implies integrity
protection only, 56 allows DES or other weak ciphers, 112
allows triple DES and other strong ciphers, 128 allows RC4,
Blowfish and other modern strong ciphers.  The default is 0.
The
.B maxssf=<factor> 
property specifies the maximum acceptable
.I security strength factor
as an integer (see minssf description).  The default is INT_MAX.
The
.B maxbufsize=<size> 
property specifies the maximum security layer receive buffer
size allowed.  0 disables security layers.  The default is 65536.
.TP
.B schemacheck { on | off }
Turn schema checking on or off. The default is on.
.TP
.B security <factors>
Specify a set of factors (separated by white space) to require.
An integer value is associated with each factor and is roughly
equivalent of the encryption key length to require.  A value
of 112 is equivalent to 3DES, 128 to Blowfish, etc..
The directive may be specified globally and/or per-database.

specifies the TLS security strength factor to require for
directory updates.
.B update_sasl=<n>
specifies the SASL security strength factor to require for
directory updates.
Note that the
.B transport
factor is measure of security provided by the underlying transport,
e.g. ldapi:// (and eventually IPSEC).  It is not normally used.
.TP
.B sizelimit <integer>
Specify the maximum number of entries to return from a search operation.
The default size limit is 500.
.TP
.B srvtab <filename>
Specify the srvtab file in which the kerberos keys necessary for
authenticating clients using kerberos can be found. This option is only
meaningful if you are using Kerberos authentication.
.TP
.B schemacheck { on | off }
Turn schema checking on or off. The default is on.
.TP
.B sizelimit <integer>
Specify the maximum number of entries to return from a search operation.
The default size limit is 500.
.TP

authenticating clients using kerberos can be found. This option is only
meaningful if you are using Kerberos authentication.
.TP
.B threads <integer>
Specify the maximum size of the primary thread pool.
The default is 32.
.TP
.B timelimit <integer>
Specify the maximum number of seconds (in real time)
.B slapd
will spend answering a search request.  The default time limit is 3600.
.SH TLS OPTIONS
If
.B slapd
is build with support for Transport Layer Security, there are more options
you can specify.
.TP
.B TLSCipherSuite <cipher-suite-spec>
Permits configuring what ciphers will be accepted and the preference order.
<cipher-suite-spec> should be a cipher specification for OpenSSL.  Example:

TLSCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:+SSLv2

To check what ciphers a given spec selects, use:

openssl ciphers -v <cipher-suite-spec>
.TP
.B TLSCertificateFile <filename>
Specifies the file that contains the
.B slapd
server certificate.
.TP
.B TLSCertificateKeyFile <filename>
Specifies the file that contains the
.B slapd
server private key that matches the certificate stored in the
.B TLSCertificateFile
file.  Currently, the private key must not be protected with a password, so
it is of critical importance that it is protected carefully. 
.TP
.B TLSRandFile <filename>
Specifies the file to obtain random bits from when /dev/[u]random
is not available.  Generally set to the name of the EGD/PRNGD socket.
The environment variable RANDFILE can also be used to specify the filename.
.SH GENERAL BACKEND OPTIONS
Options in this section only apply to the configuration file section
for the backend in which they are defined.  They are supported by every
type of backend.
.TP
.B database <databasetype>
Mark the beginning of a new database instance definition. <databasetype>
should be one of
.B ldbm,
.B shell,
or
.B passwd
depending on which backend will serve the database.
.TP
.B lastmod on | off
Controls whether
.B slapd
will automatically maintain the 
modifiersName, modifyTimestamp, creatorsName, and 
createTimestamp attributes for entries.  By default, lastmod is on.
.TP
.B readonly on | off
This option puts the database into "read-only" mode.  Any attempts to 
modify the database will return an "unwilling to perform" error.  By
default, readonly is off.
.HP
.B replica host=<hostname>[:port] [tls=yes|critical]
.B bindmethod=simple|sasl [binddn=<simple DN>] [credentials=<simple password>]
.B [saslmech=<SASL mech>] [secopts=<options>] [realm=<realm>]
.B [authcId=<authentication ID>] [authcId=<authentication ID>]
.RS
Specify a replication site for this database.  Refer to the "OpenLDAP 
Administrator's Guide" for detailed information on setting up a replicated
.B slapd
directory service. A
.B bindmethod
of
.B simple
requires the options
.B binddn 
and
.B credentials  
and should only be used when adequate security services 
(e.g TLS or IPSEC) are in place. A
.B bindmethod 
of
.B sasl 
requires the option
.B saslmech. 
If the 
.B mechanism
will use Kerberos, a kerberos instance should be given in 
.B authcId.
.RE
.TP
.B replogfile <filename>
Specify the name of the replication log file to log changes to.  
The replication log is typically written by
.BR slapd (8)
and read by
.BR slurpd (8).
See
.BR slapd.replog (5)
for more information.  The specified file should be located
in a directory with limited read/write/execute access as the replication
logs may contain sensitive information.
.TP
.B rootdn <dn>
Specify the distinguished name that is not subject to access control 
or administrative limit restrictions for operations on this database.
This DN may or may not be associated with an entry.  An empty root
DN (the default) specifies no root access is to be granted.  It is
recommended that the rootdn only be specified when needed (such as
when initially populating a database).  If the rootdn is within
a namingContext (suffix) of the database, a simple bind password
may also be provided using the
.B rootpw
directive.
.TP
.B rootpw <password>
Specify a password (or hash of the password) for the rootdn.  If
the rootdn is not within the namingContext of the database, the
provided password is ignored.
This option accepts all RFC 2307 userPassword formats known to
the server (see 
.B password-hash
desription) as well as cleartext.
.BR slappasswd (8) 
may be used to generate a hash of a password.  Cleartext
and \fB{CRYPT}\fP passwords are not recommended.  If empty
(the default), authentication of the root DN is by other means
(e.g. SASL).  Use of SASL is encouraged.
.TP
.B suffix <dn suffix>
Specify the DN suffix of queries that will be passed to this 
backend database.  Multiple suffix lines can be given and at least one is 
required for each database definition.
.TP
.B updatedn <dn>
This option is only applicable in a slave
.B slapd.
It specifies the DN allowed to make changes to the replica (typically,
this is the DN
.BR slurpd (8)
binds as when making changes to the replica).
.TP
.B updateref <url>
Specify the referral to pass back when
.BR slapd (8)
is asked to modify a replicated local database.
If specified multiple times, each url is provided.
.SH LDBM BACKEND-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
Options in this category only apply to the LDBM backend database. That is,
they must follow a "database ldbm" line and come before any subsequent
"database" lines.  The LDBM backend is a high-performance database that
makes extensive use of indexing and caching to speed data access. 
.TP
.B cachesize <integer>
Specify the size in entries of the in-memory cache maintained 
by the LDBM backend database instance.  The default is 1000 entries.
.TP
.B dbcachesize <integer>
Specify the size in bytes of the in-memory cache associated 
with each open index file. If not supported by the underlying database 
method, this option is ignored without comment.  The default is 100000 bytes.
.TP
.B dbnolocking
Specify that no database locking should be performed.  
Enabling this option may improve performance at the expense of data security.
.B dbnosync
Specify that on-disk database contents should not be immediately
synchronized with in memory changes.  Enabling this option may improve
performance at the expense of data security.
.TP
.B directory <directory>
Specify the directory where the LDBM files containing this database and
associated indexes live.  A separate directory must be specified for
each database.  The default is
.BR LOCALSTATEDIR/openldap-ldbm .
.TP
.B
index {<attrlist>|default} [pres,eq,approx,sub,<special>]
Specify the indexes to maintain for the given attribute. If only 
an <attr> is given, the indices specified for \fBdefault\fR
are maintained.  A number of special index parameters may be
specified.
The index type
.B sub
can be decomposed into
.BR subinitial ,
.BR subany ,\ and
.B subfinal
indices.
The special type
.B lang
may be specified to allow use of this index by language subtypes.
The special type
.B autolang
may be specified to automatically maintain separate indices for each
language subtypes.
The special type
.B subtypes
may be specified to allow use of this index by named subtypes.
The special type
.B autosubtypes
may be specified to automatically maintain separate indices for each
other subtypes.
.TP
.B mode <integer>
Specify the file protection mode that newly created database 
index files should have.  The default is 0600.
.SH SHELL BACKEND-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
Options in this category only apply to the SHELL backend database. That is,
they must follow a "database shell" line and come before any subsequent
"database" lines.  The Shell backend executes external programs to
implement operations, and is designed to make it easy to tie an existing
database to the
.B slapd
front-end.
.TP
.B bind <pathname>
.TP
.B unbind <pathname>
.TP
.B search <pathname>
.TP
.B compare <pathname>
.TP
.B modify <pathname>
.TP
.B modrdn <pathname>
.TP
.B add <pathname>
.TP
.B delete <pathname>
.TP
.B abandon <pathname>
These options specify the pathname of the command to execute in response 
to the given LDAP operation.
.LP
Note that you need only supply configuration lines for those commands you
want the backend to handle. Operations for which a command is not
supplied will be refused with an "unwilling to perform" error.
.SH PASSWORD BACKEND-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
Options in this category only apply to the PASSWD backend database.
That is, they must follow a "database passwd" line and come before any
subsequent "database" lines.  The PASSWD database serves up the user
account information listed in the system
.BR passwd (5)
file.
.TP
.B file <filename>
Specifies an alternate passwd file to use.  The default is
.B /etc/passwd.
