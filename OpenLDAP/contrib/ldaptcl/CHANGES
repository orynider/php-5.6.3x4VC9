Package version 1.2:

- Filter no longer a required controlArray member, defaults to objectclass=*.
- Sets errorCode with LDAP macro string value (better to test than the more
  human readable values).
- Shorten minimum required characters for search scope definitions: now allows
  "base", "one", and "sub".  For the latter two, additional characters are
  ignored.
- Now compiles successfully with -devel branch.
- Client cache management code enabled for OpenLDAP versions <= 1.2.4.  (This
  code is relatively untested and feedback is welcome.)
