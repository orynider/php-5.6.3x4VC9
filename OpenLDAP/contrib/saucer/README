This directory contains a set of files that build a simple LDAP client
program.  The program is command-line oriented and uses a syntax and
command set roughly similar to ISODE's DISH program, hence it is
named "saucer" (i.e. a very small "dish" :-)

To build saucer, you must first build OpenLDAP, and then say
	cd contrib/saucer
	make depend
	make
You can then install it by doing an "su" and typing "make install".
This will copy the binary to the directory you specified for LDAP
binaries, and the man page will be placed in the appropriate man
directory.

If you wish saucer to use GNU Readline, you must have set CPPFLAGS and
LDFLAGS so that <readline/readline.h> and -lreadline will be found when
you configured OpenLDAP, e.g.
  env CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/gnu/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/gnu/lib" ./configure


Saucer runs from the Unix command line with the following arguments:

  saucer [-h host] [-p portnumber] [-u 'X500UserName']
         [-c credentials] [-d debug-level]

If no options are given, saucer will attempt to connect to an LDAP
daemon on the local host and default port (389), and will attempt to
bind anonymously.

Typing "help" at saucer's command prompt will yield:

saucer dn=> help
Supported commands are:
  help
  list
  moveto
  quit
  search
  set
  show

You can get syntactical help for a command by typing "help <command>".
Detailed instructions are available from the saucer man page.
