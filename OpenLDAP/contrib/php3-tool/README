This is the first version of this README
php3-tool v0.2gamma
This package has been tested and run with apache/php3 and OpenLDAP 1.1-devel
Look at the php3tool.conf (no need to at present) . The file format is  exactly
the same as CSS1/2. No particular reason, just that I like it..
So you have something like:
PATH {
	attributes: "at.conf";
	photo: "ldap-photo.php3";
}

Section PATH, which has following attribute-value pairs:
attributes: "at.conf"
this pair defines where the schema stuff is.
photo: "ldap-photo.php3";
this pair defines which script to use to fetch and convert photos for an entry.

Also look at the at.conf (where all your schema stuff is). Format of at.conf is like follows:
string,Human Readable Representation,VISIBLE
So, for example
homephone,Home Telephone Number,TRUE
will _show_ anyone's home phone if it is present and will display it as "Home Telephone Number". I think the rest is self-explanatory.

I really couldn't think of anything else to put here (at the moment that is). But please feel free to add whatever else you consider neccessary to understanding how this thing works. Enjoy, and I hope this can be useful to you in some miniscule way.

p.s. do _NOT_ forget to add this to your /etc/httpd/conf/srm.conf (or wherever your put it):
DorectoryIndex .... index.php3 ...
