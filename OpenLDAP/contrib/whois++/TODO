		Things to do list (well the start of one anyway :-)

. Test on something other than Ultrix
. Finish the multilingual support.
. Make the parser for the query "language" more error resistant
. Do a real parser for the config file
. More help files
. Think about multi charset, although this is probably an issue for LDAP
. Kerberos authentication
