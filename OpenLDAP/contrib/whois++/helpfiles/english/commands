The whois++ query langauge contains a number of mandatory commands which all
servers should support but there are also a number of optional commands. In
order that a client can find out what commands are supported by a server
there is a mandatory command called "command" that should provide a list of 
all commands supported by the server. If you wish to use a command that is
optional you may wish to use the "command" command to find out if the server
supports it.

This server only supports the mandatory commands.
