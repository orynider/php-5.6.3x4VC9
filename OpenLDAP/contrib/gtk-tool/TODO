LOADS!!!

Please someone test this with old U-MICH API - hopefully all is as it should be.

Priorities:
	Now that we have cn=config we can start using ldap_get_option propperly
	and be able to run/stop server from the gtk-tool. Other things like
	new entries would now come in handy.
	Implement searches
	Integrate with OpenLDAP build - autoconf stuff (anyone?)

Optional:
	comments in the source code	
	port it to NT so we can use it with the NT port of OpenLDAP
	(they say that there is an NT port of Gtk+?)
