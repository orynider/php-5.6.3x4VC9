Please read this carefully

To copile gtk-tool, although OpenLDAP in itself is a very out-of-the-box 
straightforward piece of code to compile gtk-tool isn't. You will require following:

	Gtk+1.2.x
	Gtk--1.1.x 

So, latest gtk stuff and if you successfully compiled and installed all that it should be easy. If you didn't I really hope you can take some comfort in that I have provided you with some snapshots of what the thing actually looks like. I hope in the near future I would be able to provide you with a static binary..next week perhaps..I don't know, I'm looking for a job right now so no promises...
(I'm no longer looking for a job but the situation with spare time seems even worse - I wish I could do this full-time guys, I really do...)
