The OpenLDAP build environment relies on non-standard versions of
configuration tools:
	Autoconf 1.13.1
	Automake 1.4a
	Libtool 1.3.5 w/ patches

The autoconf/automake releases used are available at:
	ftp://ftp.openldap.org/pub/tools/

The libtool release used is available from:
	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/

but with ltconfig and ltmain.sh replaced with versions found in
this directory.
