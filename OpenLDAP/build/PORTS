This file gives some helpful hints for building LDAP on various machines.

LDAP has been built and tested on the following platforms.  It will
probably build fine under similar versions of the OS (e.g. it has
been built and tested under SunOS 4.1.4, but probably builds fine
under all SunOS 4.1.x systems).

If you port LDAP to a new platform, let us know so we can add it here.
See the end of this file for some hints on doing a port.  The following
tables give some indication of the level of support there is for various
platforms where the LDAP release has been built.  Key:

    X - all pieces are known to build and work
    B - all pieces build and are believed to work
    S - some pieces build and work
    O - an older LDAP release has been ported here; current status unknown
    ? - unknown
    - - does not build and/or work at all

** Hints on Porting LDAP to a New Platform

If your platform is not listed here, you will need to do a port.  The
place to start for Unix systems is by creating a new directory under
the LDAP build/platforms directory and creating an appropriate
Make-platform file.  It is probably easiest to start by duplicating a
directory there that is for a platform similar to yours.

Variables commonly set in the Make-platform files include:

CC              - compiler to use, e.g. CC=cc or CC=gcc
PLATFORMCFLAGS  - flags added to every compile
PLATFORMLDFLAGS - flags added to every link
PLATFORMLIBS    - extra libraries needed (added to the end of all link commands)
LDBMLIB         - ndbm library, needed if not in libc (e.g. LDBMLIB=-lndbm)
NEEDUNPROTO=yes - set if your compiler doesn't understand prototypes; see the
                      sunos4-cc and hpux-cc files for example usage
INSTALL         - BSD-like install command; if necessary, you can use a script
                      we provide:  INSTALL=$(LDAPSRC)/build/install.sh
RANLIB          - command to convert libraries for efficient random access;
                      if your system has no ranlib, use RANLIB = ""
other commands  - see the file build/Make-append for a list

You will also need to modify the top-level LDAP Makefile .make-platform
rule to know about your platform.  Finally, you should look through the
include/portable.h file and make any necessary adjustments.

Please send changes via e-mail to:  ldap-support@umich.edu so they can be
incorporated into future releases.
