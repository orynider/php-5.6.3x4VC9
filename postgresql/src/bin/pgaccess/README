PGACCESS 0.98.7 27 January 2001
================================
I dedicate this program to my little daughters Ana-Maria and Emilia and to my
wife for their understanding. I hope they will forgive me for spending so many
time far from them.



1. How to INSTALL ?

You will need a Tcl/Tk package greater than  8.0

For Unix users, unpack the pgaccess-xxx.tar.gz archieve in you preferred
directory (usually /usr/local).

Check where your "wish" program is and modify (if needed) the file
/usr/local/pgaccess/pgaccess and set variables PGACCESS_HOME and 
PATH_TO_WISH to the appropriate directories.

Include the /usr/local/pgaccess directory into your PATH or make a
symbolic link to it wherever you want (in PATH directories).
Example:

$ ln -s /usr/local/pgaccess/pgaccess /usr/bin/pgaccess

You will find also some documentation and FAQ in the doc directory.



2. Usage

You run it with the command:

        pgaccess [database]

[database] is optional.



3. Bug reporting

First of all : operating system, PostgreSQL version,Tcl/Tk version.
A more detailed story of what have you done when error occurred.
Tcl/Tk stops usually with a error message and there is a button there
"Stack Trace" and if you press it, you will see a detailed information
about the procedure containing the error. Please send it to me.
Some information about table structure, no. of fields, records would
be also good.

===========================================================================
You would find always the latest version at   http://www.flex.ro/pgaccess

Please feel free to e-mail me with any suggestion or bug description
that will help to improve it.
