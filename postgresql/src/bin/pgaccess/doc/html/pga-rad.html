PgAccess - Scripts and Forms&nbsp;
<HR WIDTH="100%"></H1>
Beginning with 0.70 version, I have introduced in PgAccess two new modules
for operating with scripts and forms.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This would give to PgAccess the power of creating application
directly into PgAccess, defining new modules, procedures, forms and possibly
making it a rapid development tool for PostgreSQL. The "scripts" and "forms"
modules are using two new tables called pga_forms and pga_scripts. PgAccess
take care of creating them if user is opening a new database and grant
ALL permissions on them to PUBLIC.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, when Designing a script, a simple text editor
is opened and text is saved as is in pga_scripts table. When "designing"
a form, a "form editor" that would be very similar with "Visual Tcl" is
invoked.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This mechanism and the extremely versatile scripting mode
of Tcl/Tk would give PgAccess a great power for creating end user application
using PostgreSQL. The most important thing is that the user could call
procedures and functions that I have used for building up PgAccess !
<H3>
Forms</H3>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forms are used for creating windows and placing widgets inside
it. When PgAccess interpret them, a new window appear, with buttons as
defined that could call "user defined scripts", "user defined procedures"
or "internal PgAccess procedures".
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Forms can hold all the widgets allowed in Tcl/Tk , buttons,
check-boxes, radio-buttons, list-boxes, frames, canvases, etc. With these
forms, you can control your application so PgAccess would become just a
"shell", a startup point for you applications. See the&nbsp; <A HREF="forms.html">special
section concerning forms.</A>
<H3>
Scripts</H3>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Scripts are normal Tcl/Tk code that is interpreted by Tcl/Tk.
You can define your own procedures inside a script called "Library" for
example. You can call your procedures from within another script, from
another procedure.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The most important thing is that you have total access
to the PgAccess core of functions and procedures used by me in building
PgAccess as an application. Just write <B><TT><FONT COLOR="#000080">open_table
"Your sample table"</FONT></TT></B> and you'll see the result.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are writing a script called "Autoexec" then it
will be executed every time the database is opened. You can put inside
different commands that you want to be executed such as : running scripts
that would define your own procedures such as <B><TT><FONT COLOR="#000080">execute_script
"My own procedure library"</FONT></TT></B> or open a form with <B><TT><FONT COLOR="#000080">open_form
"Main window with menu buttons"</FONT></TT></B> , and so on.
