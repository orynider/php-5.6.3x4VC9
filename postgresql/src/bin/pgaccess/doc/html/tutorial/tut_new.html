<h2>Creating a table</h2>
At the right is the window you should see when PgAccess starts up. The first
task for most users will be to create a database.  Notice the 'buttons' at the 
left of the main window.  Clicking on these allows you to see the names of 
different <em>objects</em> that are stored in your database, which should be 
empty at the moment.<p> 
Click the <em>Tables</em> and <em>New</em> buttons to bring up the window shown 
below.  This will allow you to specify the structure of the new table.  It is 
important to note that if you haven't specified a database when starting up 
PgAccess, this table will be created in the database named 
<samp>&lt;username&gt;</samp>, your username.<p>
Assume that you want to create a table with entries describing bibliographic 
references in the field of psychology.  Choose a table name, such as
<samp>psyref</samp> that will be easy to recall and find in a list.  Enter the
table name in the first input field.<p>
When you already have tables in a database, you can use the <em>Inherits</em>
button to toggle a list of existing tables to inherit characteristics of another
table.  In this example, there should be no previous tables to use.<p>
Enter each field, giving it a name, field type and size, if the field type does
not imply the size.  That is, if your first field was to be a sequence number,
and you selected <em>int2</em> as the field type, you would not have to specify
a field size.  However, if your second field was to contain the author of the
reference, and was a <em>varchar</em> type, you would have to specify how many
characters would be allowed in the field.<p>
As you enter each field, click the <em>Add field</em> button to add it to the
list at the right side of the window.  You can change the position of fields
using the <em>Move field up</em> and <em>Move field down</em> buttons, or delete
a field if you decide it isn't what you wanted.  When you are finished
specifying fields, press the <em>Create table</em> button.<p>
