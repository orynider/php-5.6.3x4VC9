<a name="admin"><h2>User Administration</h2>
The procedure for setting up <b>postgreSQL</b> usually results in a single user
named <samp>postgres</samp>.  In order for anyone else to use <b>postgreSQL</b>,
users must be added.  The program <samp>createuser</samp> accomplishes this. 
First become the PostgreSQL administrator (usually <samp>postgres</samp>):<p>
<samp>su postgres</samp><p>
Then create a new user:<p>
<samp>createuser jim<br>
Enter user's postgres ID or RETURN to use unix user ID: 500 -&gt;<br>
Is user "jim" allowed to create databases (y/n) y<br>
Is user "jim" a superuser? (y/n) n<br>
createuser: jim was successfully added</samp><p>
You can use either the UNIX user ID or the postgres ID to identify users.  See
the <b>postgreSQL</b> documentation in the "admin" section for a fuller
account of users and groups.<p>
To remove users, use the <samp>destroyuser</samp> command in the same way.<p>

<a name="basic"><h2>Basic use of PgAccess</h2>
<h3>Creating a database</h3>
At the right is the window you should see when PgAccess starts up. The first
task for most users will be to create a database.<p> 
Press the <em>New</em> button to bring up the window shown below.  This will
allow you to specify the structure of the new table.  It is important to note
that if you haven't specified a database when starting up PgAccess, this table
will be created in the database named <samp>&lt;username&gt;</samp>, your
username.<p>
Assume that you want to create a table with entries describing bibliographic 
references in the field of chemistry.  Choose a table name, such as
<samp>chemref</samp> that will be easy to recall and find in a list.  Enter the
table name in the first input field.<p>
When you already have tables in a database, you can use the <em>Inherits</em>
button to toggle a list of existing tables to inherit characteristics of another
table.  In this example, there should be no previous tables to use.<p>
Enter each field, giving it a name, field type and size, if the field type does
not imply the size.  That is, if your first field was to be a sequence number,
and you selected <em>int2</em> as the field type, you would not have to specify
a field size.  However, if your second field was to contain the author of the
reference, and was a <em>varchar</em> type, you would have to specify how many
characters would be allowed in the field.<p>
As you enter each field, click the <em>Add field</em> button to add it to the
list at the right side of the window.  You can change the position of fields
using the <em>Move field up</em> and <em>Move field down</em> buttons, or delete
a field if you decide it isn't what you wanted.  When you are finished
specifying fields, press the <em>Create table</em> button.<p>
