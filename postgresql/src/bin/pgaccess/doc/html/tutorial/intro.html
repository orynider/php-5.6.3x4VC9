<h1>PgAccess - Introduction</h1>
<a name="whatpga"><h2>What is PgAccess?</h2> 
PgAccess is a graphical user interface for the PostgreSQL database management
system written in the Tcl/Tk scripting language by Constantin Teodorescu.  It 
allows the user to interact with PostgreSQL in a manner similar to many PC 
database applications, with menu choices and graphical tools like buttons.  
This means that the user can avoid the basic command line interface for most 
common tasks.  PgAccess doesn't change the way PostgreSQL operates, just makes 
it easier to use for those familiar with graphical interfaces.<p>
Obviously, you <u>must</u> have PostgreSQL installed and running, and Tcl/Tk on
your system before you can use PgAccess.<p>
PgAccess is an "open source" application.  The source code is available to the 
user, and may be modified by the user.  The user can fix a bug, or change the 
way a function operates.  You may not want to get that involved with the
programming, but you have the option to do so.  If you feel you have made an
improvement to the program, you are encouraged to share it with other users.<p>
If you are not familiar with how open source software can be altered and
redistributed, please read <a href="copyright.html">this</a>.<p>
