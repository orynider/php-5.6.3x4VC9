<h1>Common Problems with PgAccess</h1>
<a name="connfail"><h2>Connection failure</h2>
One of the most common initial problems is the message:<p>
<samp>Error connecting database<br>
Connection to database failed<br>
connectDB() failed: Is the<br>
postmaster running and<br>
accepting TCP/IP (with -i)<br>
connections at 'localhost' on<br>
port '5432'?</samp><p>
This usually occurs because the "postmaster" (the postgreSQL backend) was not
started with the <samp>-i</samp> option.  Usually just adding <samp>-i</samp> to
the command line that starts the postmaster and restarting will fix this.
<a name="libpg"><h2>libpgtcl not found</h2>
PgAccess requires a library of functions named <samp>libpgtcl</samp>.  This
should be available with the postgreSQL distribution, and is usually placed in
the correct location when installing postgreSQL.  First check that there is a
file named <samp>libpgtcl.so</samp> (perhaps with a number appended - or
<samp>libpgtcl.dll</samp> on Windows systems) on your
system.  If not, you will have to download and perhaps compile this library.<p>
<samp>ftp://ftp.flex.ro/pub/pgaccess</samp><p>
is one place that you can download precompiled libpgtcl libraries for
PgAccess.<p>

<h2>Locale specific characters</h2>
This problem occurs with some special characters used in different
countries because PgAccess did not use fonts with `-ISO8859-1' encoding.<p>
One solution was proposed by H.P.Heidinger ( hph@hphbbs.ruhr.de) and
is very simple.<p>
If you look in the file pgaccess.tcl, you will find the fonts declared in 
this manner:<p>
<TT>$ grep -e '-font' -i pgaccess.tcl<BR>
-font -Adobe-Helvetica-Medium-R-Normal--*-120-*-*-*-*-*-* \<br>
...</TT></P>
The font declarations should be altered to:<p>
<tt>-font -Adobe-Helvetica-Medium-R-Normal-*-*-120-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1<br>
...</tt><p>
That is, inserting an asterisk between the first pair of hyphens, and changing
the final two asterisks to <samp>iso8859</samp> and <samp>1</samp>
respectively.<p>
You can alter the source code by running the following script :
<P><TT>#!/bin/sh<BR>
cp pgaccess.tcl pgaccess.tcl-org<BR>
cat pgaccess.tcl |\<BR>
sed -e's/\-\*\-\*\ /\-iso8859\-1\ /g' |\<BR>
sed -e's/\-\*\-\*\}/\-iso8859\-1}/g' |\<BR>
sed -e's/\-\*\-\*\]/\-iso8859\-1]/g' |\<BR>
sed -e's/\-\*\-\*$/\-iso8859\-1/g' |\<BR>
sed -e's/\-Clean\-/\-Fixed\-/g' |\<BR>
sed -e's/clean/fixed/g' &gt;pgaccess.iso<BR>
mv pgaccess.iso pgaccess.tcl<BR>
chmod +x pgaccess.tcl</TT><P>
The final version of PgAccess (1.0) will let the user decide what fonts
will be used through a &quot;preferences&quot; dialog window.</p>

<h2>Problem with PostgreSQL 6.3.x</h2>
PgAccess 0.93 and later may have problems working with PostgreSQL 6.3.x.
Changes in libpgtcl have been made to remove these, but if you are
using PostgreSQL 6.3.x, this patch will allow you to get around the problems.<p>
In the procedure <tt>wpg_exec</tt> change the following line:<p>
<tt>set pgsql(errmsg) [pg_result $pgsql(res) -error]</tt><p>
to this:<p>
<tt>set pgsql(errmsg) "NO ERROR INFORMATION SUPPLIED"</tt><p>
and the program will work. The only disadvantage is that with some error 
conditions, you will not get the appropriate error message from libpgtcl.<p>
