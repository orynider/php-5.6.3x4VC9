<h1>PgAccess Tutorial - User Administration</h1>
While user administration is really not a part of the PgAccess program, it is 
such a basic operation that a brief description is given here.
<h2>Creating users</h2>
The procedure for setting up <b>postgreSQL</b> usually results in a single user
named <samp>postgres</samp>.  In order for anyone else to use <b>postgreSQL</b>,
users must be added.  The program <samp>createuser</samp> accomplishes this. 
First become the PostgreSQL administrator (usually <samp>postgres</samp>):<p>
<samp>su postgres</samp><p>
Then create a new user:<p>
<samp>createuser jim<br>
Enter user's postgres ID or RETURN to use unix user ID: 500 -&gt;<br>
Is user "jim" allowed to create databases (y/n) y<br>
Is user "jim" a superuser? (y/n) y<br>
createuser: jim was successfully added</samp><p>
You can use either the UNIX user ID or the postgres ID to identify users.  See
the <b>postgreSQL</b> documentation in the "admin" section for a fuller
account of users and groups.<p>
The reason for using the command line to create the first user (other than
<em>postgres</em>) is that <em>postgres</em> may not have X-Window permission.
You can also create users using <b>PgAccess</b> if you are created as a 
<em>superuser</em> as shown in the example above.<p>
<h2>Removing users</h2>
To remove users, use the <samp>destroyuser</samp> command in the same way.<p>
