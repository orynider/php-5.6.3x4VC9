<h1>PgAccess - Getting Started</h1>
<a name="getpga"><h2>How to get PgAccess</h2>
If you have this HTML help system, you have probably already downloaded 
PgAccess.  If not, or you wish to download the latest version, it is available
from the URL:<p>
<samp>http://www.flex.ro</samp><p>
The home page will contain instructions on which files to download for your
operating system.  Download the file to a directory where the program will
eventually reside (see below).<p>
<a name="uncpga"><h2>How to uncompress PgAccess</h2>
PgAccess, like most applications available for download, is usually downloaded 
in compressed format to save download time.  You must uncompress these files in
order to use the application.<p>
<h3>UNIX (Linux, BSD, IRIX, Solaris, etc.)</h3>
The files will be compressed using "gzip" and packaged using "tar", and have
filenames like this:<p>
<samp>pgaccess-n.nn.tar.gz</samp><p>
Note that "n.nn" will be the version number in an actual file.<p>
First decide where you want to have the program.  A typical location on UNIX
systems is <samp>/usr/local/src/&lt;name&gt;</samp>, where &lt;name&gt; is the name of
the program.  To use this location, download or move the "tar.gz" file to the
directory <samp>/usr/local/src</samp>.  Change to that directory, and 
uncompress the file with the command:<p>
<samp>tar -zxvf pgaccess-n.nn.tar.gz</samp><p>
You should see the files listed as they are uncompressed and placed in the new
directory, and now have a directory named:<p>
<samp>/usr/local/src/pgaccess</samp><p>
In that directory will be all of the files that were packaged in the downloaded
file.  When you have PgAccess working, you can delete the file with the ".tar"
or ".tar.gz" extension.
<h3>Windows</h3>
The files will be compressed so that "WinZip" will uncompress the package.  Just
open the file with "WinZip" and the program files will be extracted.<p>
<a name="putpga"><h2>Putting PgAccess where it will be found</h2>
<h3>UNIX</h3>
In order to run PgAccess easily, the program file "pgaccess.tcl" should be in a
location on the "PATH" of the system.  You can find out what the PATH is by
entering:<p>
<samp>echo $PATH<br>
/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/bin:./:/usr/local/pgsql/bin
</samp><p>
Usually the directory <samp>/usr/local/bin</samp> will be in your PATH, and that
is a fairly common place to put programs like PgAccess.  Other common
directories in the PATH are <samp>/usr/bin</samp> and <samp>/usr/sbin</samp>. 
Simply move the file "pgaccess.tcl" to the directory where you want it.<p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
You will usually link PgAccess to an icon, so just specify the full path to the
program when you create the icon.
<a name=startpga"><h2>Starting PgAccess</h2>
The easiest way to start PgAccess is to simply invoke the program by name:<p>
<samp>pgaccess.tcl</samp><p>
If the program has been placed in a directory listed in the PATH, the PgAccess 
window should appear.<p>
<h3>Starting from a menu</h3>
Most users will want to link the program to a menu or icon so that it can be 
started using the mouse or other pointing device.  Here is a method that will
work on most Linux X-Windows systems.  Create a file named "pgaccess" in the directory
<samp>/etc/X11/wmconfig</samp> with the following contents:<p>
<samp>pgaccess name "PgAccess"<br>
pgaccess description "postgreSQL frontend"<br>
pgaccess mini-icon "mini-pgaccess.xpm"<br>
pgaccess group "Applications"<br>
pgaccess exec "pgaccess.tcl &"</samp><p>
This assumes that you have an "Applications" sub-menu.  You may prefer
"Programs" or some other place.  Also, you will have to create the
"mini-pgaccess.xpm" icon if you want it to appear.  You can edit an existing
icon from the <samp>/usr/share/icons/mini</samp> directory in XPaint and rename
it.  When you next start an X-Windows session, there should be a "PgAccess" item
on the menu that you have chosen.  Clicking on this item should start
PgAccess.<p>
