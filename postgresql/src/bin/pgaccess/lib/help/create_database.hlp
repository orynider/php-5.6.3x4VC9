" {code} "Inputs" {bold} "

" {} "name" {italic} "
       The name of a database to create. 

" {} "dbpath" {italic} "
       An alternate location can be specified as either an environment variable known to the backend server (e.g. 'PGDATA2') or as an absolute path name (e.g. '/usr/local/pgsql/data'). In \
       either case, the location must be pre-configured by initlocation. 

" {} "Outputs" {bold} "

" {} "CREATEDB" {italic} "
       Message returned if the command completes successfully. 

" {} "WARN: createdb: database \"name\" already exists." {italic} "
       This occurs if database specified already exists. 

" {} "ERROR: Unable to create database directory directory" {italic} "
       There was a problem with creating the required directory; this operation will need permissions for the postgres user on the specified location. 

" {} "Usage" {bold} "

   olly=> create database lusiadas;

" {} "Bugs" {bold} "

There are security and data integrity issues involved with using alternate database locations specified with absolute path names, and by default only an environment variable known to the \
backend may be specified for an alternate location. See the Administrator's Guide for more information.

" {} "CREATE DATABASE" {italic} " is a Postgres language extension. 

Use " {} "DROP DATABASE" {italic} " to remove a database. "
