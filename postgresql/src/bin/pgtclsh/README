pgtclsh is an example of a tclsh extended with the new Tcl
commands provided by the libpgtcl library.  By using pgtclsh, one can
write front-end applications to PostgreSQL in Tcl without having to
deal with any libpq programming at all.  

The pgtclsh is an enhanced version of tclsh.  Similarly, pgtksh is a
wish replacement with PostgreSQL bindings.

For details of the libpgtcl interface, please see the Programmer's
Guide.
