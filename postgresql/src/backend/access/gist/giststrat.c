/*
 *	Note:  negate, commute, and negatecommute all assume that operators are
 *		   ordered as follows in the strategy map:
 *
 *		contains, contained-by
 *
 *	The negate, commute, and negatecommute arrays are used by the planner
 *	to plan indexed scans over data that appears in the qualificiation in
 *	a boolean negation, or whose operands appear in the wrong order.  For
 *	example, if the operator "<%" means "contains", and the user says
 *
 *		where not rel.box <% "(10,10,20,20)"::box
 *
 *	the planner can plan an index scan by noting that GiST indices have
 *	an operator in their operator class for negating <%.
 *
 *	Similarly, if the user says something like
 *
 *		where "(10,10,20,20)"::box <% rel.box
 *
 *	the planner can see that the GiST index on rel.box has an operator in
 *	its opclass for commuting <%, and plan the scan using that operator.
 *	This added complexity in the access methods makes the planner a lot easier
 *	to write.

 *	If you were sufficiently attentive to detail, you would go through

 *	structure that gets shipped around to help the planner and the access
 *	method decide what sort of scan it should do, based on (a) what the
 *	user asked for, (b) what operators are defined for a particular opclass,
 *	and (c) the reams of information we supplied above.
 *
 *	The idea of all of this initialized data is to make life easier on the
 *	user when he defines a new operator class to use this access method.
 *	By filling in all the data, we let him get away with leaving holes in his
 *	operator class, and still let him use the index.  The added complexity
 *	in the access methods just isn't worth the trouble, though.
