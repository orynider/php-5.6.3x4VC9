/*
 * best_or_subclause_indices
 *	  Determines the best index to be used in conjunction with each subclause
 *	  of an 'or' clause and the cost of scanning a relation using these
 *	  indices.	The cost is the sum of the individual index costs, since
 *	  the executor will perform a scan for each subclause of the 'or'.
 *	  Returns a list of IndexOptInfo nodes, one per scan.
 *
 * This routine also creates the indexqual list that will be needed by
 * the executor.  The indexqual list has one entry for each scan of the base
 * rel, which is a sublist of indexqual conditions to apply in that scan.
 * The implicit semantics are AND across each sublist of quals, and OR across
 * the toplevel list (note that the executor takes care not to return any
 * single tuple more than once).
 *
 * 'rel' is the node of the relation on which the indexes are defined
 * 'subclauses' are the subclauses of the 'or' clause
 * 'indices' is a list of sublists of the IndexOptInfo nodes that matched
 *		each subclause of the 'or' clause
 * 'pathnode' is the IndexPath node being built.
 *
 * Results are returned by setting these fields of the passed pathnode:
 * 'indexinfo' gets a list of the index IndexOptInfo nodes, one per scan
 * 'indexqual' gets the constructed indexquals for the path (a list
 *		of sublists of clauses, one sublist per scan of the base rel)
 * 'startup_cost' and 'total_cost' get the complete path costs.
 *
 * 'startup_cost' is the startup cost for the first index scan only;
 * startup costs for later scans will be paid later on, so they just
 * get reflected in total_cost.
 *
 * NOTE: we choose each scan on the basis of its total cost, ignoring startup
 * cost.  This is reasonable as long as all index types have zero or small
 * startup cost, but we might have to work harder if any index types with
 * nontrivial startup cost are ever invented.
