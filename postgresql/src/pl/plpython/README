Installation:

configure --with-python
cd src/pl/plpython
gmake
gmake install

Test:

# have postmaster running...
gmake installcheck

Enable language:

createlang plpython dbname


Note that PL/Python is currently not built automatically because the
code is new and there are some portability issues.

A default Python installation does not provide a shared libpython
library.  This is not a problem on many platforms (although it makes
things less efficient), but on some platforms (especially HP-UX) the
link will fail outright.

To create a shared libpython, see this web page for hints:

http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/faqw.py?req=show&file=faq03.030.htp

Place the resulting library in the same directory as the existing
static libpythonX.Y.a and relink plpython.


Further documentation is available in the PostgreSQL Programmer's
Guide.
