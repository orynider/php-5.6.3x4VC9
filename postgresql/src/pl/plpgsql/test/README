Test suite for PL/pgSQL

Scenario:

    A building with a modern TP cabel installation where any
    of the wall connectors can be used to plug in phones,
    ethernet interfaces or local office hubs. The backside
    of the wall connectors is wired to one of several patch-
    fields in the building.

    In the patchfields, there are hubs and all the slots
    representing the wall connectors. In addition there are
    slots that can represent a phone line from the central
    phone system.

    Triggers ensure consistency of the patching information.

    Functions are used to build up powerful views that let
    you look behind the wall when looking at a patchfield
    or into a room.
