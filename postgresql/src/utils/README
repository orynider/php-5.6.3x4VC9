The utils directory contains components that are used by multiple subsystems
in the Postgres source tree.  We don't want subsystems reaching into other
subsystems' directories and messing with the modularity of the system, so
we gather any cross-subsystem utilities here.

In particular, programs that form an interface between subsystems go here.
