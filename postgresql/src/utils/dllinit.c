   I've used DllMain as the DLL "main" since that's the most common
   usage. MSVC and Mingw32 both default to DllMain as the standard
   callback from the linker entry point. Cygwin32 b19+ uses essentially
   the same, albeit slightly differently implemented, scheme. Please
   see DECLARE_CYGWIN_DLL macro in <cygwin32/cygwin_dll.h> for more
   info on how Cygwin32 uses the callback function.

   The real entry point is typically always defined by the runtime
   library, and usually never overridden by (casual) user. What you can
   override however is the callback routine that the entry point calls,
   and this file provides such a callback function, DllMain.

   Mingw32: The default entry point for mingw32 is DllMainCRTStartup
   which is defined in libmingw32.a This in turn calls DllMain which is
   defined here. If not defined, there is a stub in libmingw32.a which
   does nothing.

   Cygwin32: The default entry point for cygwin32 b19 or newer is
   __cygwin32_dll_entry which is defined in libcygwin.a. This in turn
   calls the routine you supply to the DECLARE_CYGWIN_DLL (see below)
   and, for this example, I've chose DllMain to be consistent with all
   the other platforms.

   MSVC: MSVC runtime calls DllMain, just like Mingw32.

   Summary: If you need to do anything special in DllMain, just add it
   here. Otherwise, the default setup should be just fine for 99%+ of
   the time. I strongly suggest that you *not* change the entry point,
   but rather change DllMain as appropriate.
