Version 3.3
  A few cleanups.  Mostly there was some confusion about the latest version
  and so I am bumping the number to keep it straight.
  - Added NUMERICOID to list of returned types.  This fixes a bug when
    returning aggregates.

Version 3.2
  - Add WIN32 support (gerhard@bigfoot.de)
  - Fix some DB-API quoting problems (niall.smart@ebeon.com)
  - Moved development into PostgreSQL development tree.

Version 3.1
  - Fix some quoting functions.  In particular handle NULLs better.
  - Use a method to add primary key information rather than direct
    manipulation of the class structures.
  - Break decimal out in _quote (in pg.py) and treat it as float.
  - Treat timestamp like date for quoting purposes.
  - Remove a redundant SELECT from the get method speeding it, and insert
    since it calls get, up a little.
  - Add test for BOOL type in typecast method to pgdbTypeCache class.
    (tv@beamnet.de)
  - Fix pgdb.py to send port as integer to lower level function
    (dildog@l0pht.com)
  - Change pg.py to speed up some operations
  - Allow updates on tables with no primary keys.

Version 3.0
  - Remove strlen() call from pglarge_write() and get size from object.
    (Richard@Bouska.cz)
  - Add a little more error checking to the quote function in the wrapper
  - Add extra checking in _quote function
  - Wrap query in pg.py for debugging
  - Add DB-API 2.0 support to pgmodule.c (andre@via.ecp.fr)
  - Add DB-API 2.0 wrapper pgdb.py (andre@via.ecp.fr) 
  - Correct keyword clash (temp) in tutorial
  - Clean up layout of tutorial
  - Return NULL values as None (rlawrence@lastfoot.com)
  - Change None to NULL in insert and update
  - Change hash-bang lines to use /usr/bin/env
  - Clearing date should be blank (NULL) not TODAY
  - Quote backslashes in strings in _quote (brian@CSUA.Berkeley.EDU)
  - Expanded and clarified build instructions (tbryan@starship.python.net)
  - Make code thread safe (Jerome.Alet@unice.fr)
  - Add README.distutils (mwa@gate.net & jeremy@cnri.reston.va.us)
  - Many fixes and increased DB-API compliance by chifungfan@yahoo.com,
    tony@printra.net, jeremy@alum.mit.edu and others to get the final
    version ready to release.

Version 2.4
  - Insert returns None if the user doesn't have select permissions
    on the table.  It can (and does) happen that one has insert but
    not select permissions on a table.
  - Added ntuples() method to query object (brit@druid.net)
  - Corrected a bug related to getresult() and the money type
  - Corrected a bug related to negative money amounts
  - Allow update based on primary key if munged oid not available and
    table has a primary key
  - Add many __doc__ strings. (andre@via.ecp.fr)
  - Get method works with views if key specified

Version 2.3
  - connect.host returns "localhost" when connected to Unix socket 
    (torppa@tuhnu.cutery.fi)
  - Use PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords in connect() (torppa@tuhnu.cutery.fi)       
  - fixes and cleanups (torppa@tuhnu.cutery.fi)       
  - Fixed memory leak in dictresult() (terekhov@emc.com)
  - Deprecated pgext.py - functionality now in pg.py
  - More cleanups to the tutorial
  - Added fileno() method - terekhov@emc.com (Mikhail Terekhov)
  - added money type to quoting function
  - Compiles cleanly with more warnings turned on
  - Returns PostgreSQL error message on error
  - Init accepts keywords (Jarkko Torppa)
  - Convenience functions can be overridden (Jarkko Torppa)
  - added close() method

Version 2.2
  - Added user and password support thanks to Ng Pheng Siong <ngps@post1.com>
  - Insert queries return the inserted oid
  - Add new pg wrapper (C modile renamed to _pg)
  - Wrapped database connection in a class.
