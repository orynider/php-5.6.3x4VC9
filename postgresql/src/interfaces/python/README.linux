Thanks to thilo@eevolute.com and others for this README and the RPM

Note: The precompiled RPM package is not available at www.eevolute.com.
  You may use the spec file provided with PyGreSQL to build your
  own package.

INSTALLING PyGreSQL on Redhat Linux 5.1 or 5.2
==============================================

Things are pretty easy on Redhat Linux.  You can either get a precompiled
RPM package from

        ftp://www.eevolute.com/pub/python/

or try in compile and install it yourself:

bash$ make redhat       # this just compiles the module as a shared object
cc -fpic -shared -o _pg.so -I/usr/include/python1.5 pgmodule.c -lpq
bash$ python            # you can test it from your local directory
Python 1.5.1 (#1, May  6 1998, 01:48:27)  [GCC 2.7.2.3] on linux-i386

>>> import _pg
>>> db = _pg.connect('thilo', 'localhost')
>>> db.query("INSERT INTO test VALUES ('ping', 'pong')")
18304
>>> db.query("SELECT * FROM test")
eins|zwei
----+----
ping|pong
(1 row)

bash$ su                # Yow! Seems to work - now install it properly
bash# cp _pg.so /usr/lib/python1.5/lib-dynload 

done!

Oliver White (ojw@muzak.iinet.net.au) sent me the following information
about installing on Debian.

Hi, I thought you might want to upgrade your documentation for PyGreSQL
to let people know they can get it by simply typing 'apt-get install
python-pygresql', on debian (duh). This would have saved me a lot of
trouble.
