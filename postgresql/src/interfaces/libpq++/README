Based on the original work by William Wanders (wwanders@sci.kun.nl)
and Jolly Chen (jolly@cs.berkeley.edu), this is the first set of
changes to libpq++ since ~1997.  Pgenv has been removed, deprecated 
functions removed and/or updated and error handling rewritten, 
however for the most part it remains as a wrapper around libpq.
The documentation on libpq is recommended reading to understand 
the function of libpq++.

The API provided herein is subject to change in later versions of 
PostgreSQL.

For details on how to to use libpq++, see the man page in the man/
subdirectory and the test programs in the examples/ subdirectory.

** PgConnection has been changed to accept either the environment
variables or conninfo style strings.  See the PQconnectdb in the
documentation on libpq for details.

libpq++ has only been tested with g++, version 2.7.2.1
