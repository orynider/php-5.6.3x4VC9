 * The internal representation is a *strip*, a sequence of
 * operators ending with an endmarker.	(Some terminology etc. is a
 * historical relic of earlier versions which used multiple strips.)
 * Certain oddities in the representation are there to permit running
 * the machinery backwards; in particular, any deviation from sequential
 * flow must be marked at both its source and its destination.	Some
 * fine points:
 *
 * - OPLUS_ and O_PLUS are *inside* the loop they create.
 * - OQUEST_ and O_QUEST are *outside* the bypass they create.
 * - OCH_ and O_CH are *outside* the multi-way branch they create, while
 *	 OOR1 and OOR2 are respectively the end and the beginning of one of
 *	 the branches.	Note that there is an implicit OOR2 following OCH_
 *	 and an implicit OOR1 preceding O_CH.
 *
 * In state representations, an operator's bit is on to signify a state
 * immediately *preceding* "execution" of that operator.

 * Structure for [] character-set representation.  Character sets are
 * done as bit vectors, grouped 8 to a byte vector for compactness.
 * The individual set therefore has both a pointer to the byte vector
 * and a mask to pick out the relevant bit of each byte.  A hash code
 * simplifies testing whether two sets could be identical.
 *
 * This will get trickier for multicharacter collating elements.  As
 * preliminary hooks for dealing with such things, we also carry along
 * a string of multi-character elements, and decide the size of the
 * vectors at run time.
