 *
 * NOTE: this table has nothing to do with the overall Postgres system
 * version or anything like that.  It is for defining individual relations
 * that have multiple concurrently-existing versions.  Yes, there used to
 * be such a feature in Postgres, but it's been broken for a long time
 * (see src/backend/commands/_deadcode/version.c).	The pg_version table
 * isn't even created at present.
