#
# Example PostgreSQL charsets control file.
#
# Should be placed in $PG_DATA directory.
#
# On the fly recoding charsets, based on client's IP address.
# For example: koi8-u (koi) <-> cp1251 (win) <-> cp866 (alt)
# 

# Base charset for backend
# Most Unices use koi8-r(u) as base charset. But Solaris
# use iso8859-5 and some networkless workstations use cp866.
BaseCharset	koi

# There are recode table definitions from base charset to
# other. Table names are relative to $PG_DATA directory.
# Tables are taken from Russian Apache <http://apache.lexa.ru>.
RecodeTable	koi	alt	koi-alt.tab
RecodeTable	koi	win	koi-win.tab
RecodeTable	koi	iso	koi-iso.tab
RecodeTable	koi	koi	koi-koi.tab
RecodeTable	alt	win	othertabs/alt-win.tab
RecodeTable	alt	koi	othertabs/alt-koi.tab
RecodeTable	iso	koi	othertabs/iso-koi.tab
